# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

![Movie Recommendation](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=Movie+Recommendation+System)

## 📌 Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based project that suggests movies based on user preferences. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **collaborative filtering** techniques to provide personalized recommendations. The system processes movie metadata and user behavior to make intelligent predictions, enhancing the movie-watching experience.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎯 **Personalized Recommendations** – Uses collaborative and content-based filtering.
- 🏆 **High Accuracy (85%)** – Provides relevant suggestions.
- ⚡ **Fast and Efficient** – Optimized for real-time recommendations.
- 🖥️ **Interactive Web App** – Built using **Streamlit**.
- 📊 **Visualization Support** – Uses Matplotlib & Seaborn for insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - Pandas, NumPy – Data Processing
  - Scikit-Learn – Machine Learning
  - TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity – NLP Techniques
  - Streamlit – Web Application
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data Visualization
